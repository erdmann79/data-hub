## Python setup

For your convenience, setting up the virtual environment has been automated using poetry. https://python-poetry.org/ You must have python with poetry installed.

### Install Poetry

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
````
Feel free to look here for more instructions. Updating Poetry is very easy by the way ```poetry update```.

### Install the virtual environment

Navigate to the root directory of the project and run "poetry install"

```bash
~/projects/data-hub$ poetry install
````

### Interactive Shell

Switch to the interactive enviroment (PYTHON) by typing "poetry shell". Note the environment, the python activation, and path your the virtual environment, as well as the change to the prompt to include the current python shell and version.

```bash
$ poetry shell
~/projects/roster$ . /home/<username>/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/data-hub-JxgitZP8-py3.10/bin/activate
(data-hub-JxgitZP8-py3.10) $~/projects/data-hub$
````
